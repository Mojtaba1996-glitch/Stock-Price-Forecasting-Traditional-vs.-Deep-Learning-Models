# Stock-Price-Forecasting-Traditional-vs.-Deep-Learning-Models

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the forecasting of stock prices and market directions using a combination of traditional time series models (ARIMA) and deep learning architectures (LSTM and GRU). It aims to provide insights into the performance and accuracy of various forecasting techniques using real-world stock market data.

## Features  
- **Data Sources**: Weekly stock price and volume data from Yahoo Finance for nine Thai stocks.  
- **Models Implemented**:
  - **ARIMA**: Traditional statistical model for time series forecasting.
  - **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory neural networks for sequential data processing.
  - **GRU**: Gated Recurrent Units for efficient time series predictions.
- **Dual Input Capability**: Incorporates both price and volume data for LSTM and GRU models.  
- **Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²)
  - Directional Accuracy  
- **Visualization**: Side-by-side comparison of actual vs. predicted prices with professional plots.
- **Outputs**:
  - Forecasted prices and directions.
  - Selected stocks based on predictions.
  - CSV exports of results for further analysis.

## Technologies  
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Data Processing: `pandas`, `numpy`, `yfinance`
  - Modeling: `statsmodels`, `tensorflow`, `keras`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
